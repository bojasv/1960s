 Message . . . . :   Object is not a file or is a file with attributes not      
   supported by this command.                                                   
                                                                                
 Cause . . . . . :   Object /QSYS.LIB/QGPL.LIB/QAUOOPT.FILE/QAUOOPT.MBR must be 
   either a source physical file that has three fields or a program described   
   file. Externally described files and source physical files containing fewer  
   or more than three fields are not permitted by this command.                 
 Recovery  . . . :   Specify the name of an existing source physical file with  
   correct attributes, or specify a program described file, then try the        
   command again.
 
 Cause: The QAUOOPT file has fewer than 3 fields
