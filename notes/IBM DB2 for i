    Type (of info)
      *MBRLIST
        Member name, source type, size, description
        Created on
        Last changed on
        Current number of records (NBRCURRCD) - often used in CL as parm of RTVMBRD
        Number of deleted records
      *MBR
        Current number of records (NBRCURRCD) - often used in CL as parm of RTVMBRD
        Number of delete records
        Record capacity
        Last used date
        Days used count
        Stat for operations performed (CRUD, CLR, RGZ, CPY, Access Path build/rebuild/reads...etc)
        Member level ID
        Share ODP?
          *NO - A new ODP for the file is created and used every time a program opens the file.
          *YES - the programs accessing the file share facilities such as the file status and the buffer.
      *RCDFMT
        Record format name (same as the file name, 
        Record format description (same as file name)
        Total number of fields and record length
        Format level ID
      *TRG
      *CST
      *ACCPTH
        *IMMED - The path is updated each time a record is changed, added, or deleted from a member.
        *REBLD - The path is completely rebuilt each time a file member is opened, is maintained until the member is closed, then gets deleted.
        *DLY - The maintenance of the access path is delayed until the physical file member is opened for use.
        The access path is changed only for records that have been added, deleted, or changed since the file was last opened.
        While the file is open, all changes made to its members are immediately reflected in the access path of those members 
        (no matter what is specified for the MAINT parameter.)
        To prevent a lengthy rebuild time when the file is opened, *DLY should be specified only when the number of changes to the access path is small.
        
        If the number of changes between a close and the next open reaches approximately 10 percent of the access path size,
        the system stops saving changes and the access path is completely rebuilt the next time the file is opened.
        
        These paths can be rebuilt...
          during IPL (Initial Program Load, i.e. before any user can run a job)
          after IPL, or
          when the file is next opened (*REBLD)
        RECOVER parm is defaulted to
          *NO for files with non-Unique keys, and the path is rebuilt when the file is opened.
          *AFTIPL for files with unique keys
        
        While the access path is being rebuilt, the file cannot be used by any job.                                                
          
        The access path logical page size is used by the system to determine the size of each page of the index.
        During page fault, this much bytes of the access path data that can be movedfrom the ASP into the job's storage pool.

DB2 Extremas
CRTSRCPF
  minimum RCDLEN is 12 bytes (i.e 6 pos for source sequence number and rest 6 for the record change date), usually record data size is set to 100 bytes
    for PF it's 80 - IBM System i5 Data Description Processor
    for CL and CMD it's 96 - IBM Control Language Compiler, IBM IBM i Command Definition Compiler 
    for RPG and SQLRPG it's 100 - IBM ILE RPG Compiler (for RPG last 20 pos are reserved for Comments)
  while opening a device, a program can wait for max 9 hours to let the resources be allocated - when WAITFILE is set as *NOMAX 
  while changing or deleting a record, a program can wait for max 9 hours (32767 secs) - when WAITRCD is set as *NOMAX
