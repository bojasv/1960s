    Type (of info)
      *MBRLIST
        Member name, source type, size, description
        Created on
        Last changed on
        Current number of records (NBRCURRCD) - often used in CL as parm of RTVMBRD
        Number of deleted records
      *MBR
        Current number of records (NBRCURRCD) - often used in CL as parm of RTVMBRD
        Number of delete records
        Record capacity
        Last used date
        Days used count
        Stat for operations performed (CRUD, CLR, RGZ, CPY, Access Path build/rebuild/reads...etc)
        Member level ID
        Share ODP?
          *NO - A new ODP for the file is created and used every time a program opens the file.
          *YES - the programs accessing the file share facilities such as the file status and the buffer.
      *RCDFMT
        Record format name (same as the file name, 
        Record format description (same as file name)
        Total number of fields and record length
        Format level ID
      *TRG
      *CST
      *ACCPTH
        *IMMED - The path is updated each time a record is changed, added, or deleted from a member.
        *REBLD - The path is completely rebuilt each time a file member is opened, is maintained until the member is closed, then gets deleted.
        *DLY - The maintenance of the access path is delayed until the physical file member is opened for use.
        The access path is changed only for records that have been added, deleted, or changed since the file was last opened.
        While the file is open, all changes made to its members are immediately reflected in the access path of those members 
        (no matter what is specified for the MAINT parameter.)
        To prevent a lengthy rebuild time when the file is opened, *DLY should be specified only when the number of changes to the access path is small.
        
        If the number of changes between a close and the next open reaches approximately 10 percent of the access path size,
        the system stops saving changes and the access path is completely rebuilt the next time the file is opened.
        
        These paths can be rebuilt...
          during IPL (Initial Program Load, i.e. before any user can run a job)
          after IPL, or
          when the file is next opened (*REBLD)
        RECOVER parm is defaulted to
          *NO for files with non-Unique keys, and the path is rebuilt when the file is opened.
          *AFTIPL for files with unique keys
        
        While the access path is being rebuilt, the file cannot be used by any job.                                                
          
        The access path logical page size is used by the system to determine the size of each page of the index.
        During page fault, this much bytes of the access path data that can be movedfrom the ASP into the job's storage pool.

ACCPTH (Access Path)
 Message ID . . . . . . :   CPI4323       Severity . . . . . . . :   00         
 Message . . . . :   The query access plan has been rebuilt.                    
 Cause . . . . . :   The access plan was rebuilt for reason code 1. The reason  
   codes and their meanings follow:                                             
     0 - A new access plan was created.                                         
     1 - A file or member is not the same object as the one referred to in the  
   access plan. Some reasons include the object being re-created, restored, or  
   overriden to a new object.                                                   
     2 - Access plan was using a reusable Open Data Path (ODP), and the         
   optimizer chose to use a non-reusable ODP.                                   
     3 - Access plan was using a non-reusable Open Data Path (ODP) and the      
   optimizer chose to use a reusable ODP.                                       
     4 - The number of records in member *N of file *N in library *N has        
   changed by more than 10%.                                                    
     5 - A new access path exists over member *N of file *N in library *N.      
     6 - An access path over member *N of file *N in library *N that was used   
   for this access plan no longer exists or is no longer valid.                 
     7 - The query access plan had to be rebuilt because of system programming  
   changes.                                                                     
     8 - The CCSID (Coded Character Set Identifier) of the current job is       
   different than the CCSID used in the access plan.                            
     9 - The value of one of the following is different in the current job:     
   date format, date separator, time format, or time separator.                 
     10 - The sort sequence table specified has changed.                        
     11 - The number of active processors or the size or paging option of the   
   storage pool has changed.                                                    
     12 - The system feature DB2 Symmetric Multiprocessing has either been      
   installed or removed.                                                        
     13 - The value of the degree query attribute has changed either by the     
   CHGSYSVAL or CHGQRYA CL commands or with the query options file *N in        
   library *N.                                                                  
     14 - A view is either being opened by a high level language open, or is    
   being materialized.                                                          
     15 - A global variable or sequence object or user-defined type or function 
   is not the same object as the one referred to in the access plan; or, the    
   SQL path used to generate the access plan is different than the current SQL  
   path.                                                                        
     16 - Query attributes have been specified from the query options file *N   
   in library *N.                                                               
     17 - The access plan was generated with a commitment control level that is 
   different in the current job.                                                
     18 - The access plan was generated with a different static cursor answer   
   set size.                                                                    
     19 - This is the first run of the query since a prepare or compile.        
     20 and greater -- View the second level message text of the next message   
   issued (CPI4351) for an explanation of these reason codes.                   
     If the reason code is 4, 5, 6, 20, or 21 and the file specified in the     
   reason code explanation is a logical file, then member *N of physical file   
   *N in library *N is the file with the specified change.                      
 Recovery  . . . :   Excessive rebuilds should be avoided and may indicate an   
   application design problem.                                                  
 Technical description . . . . . . . . :   The access plan was rebuilt because  
   of reason code 1. This reason code has a sub-type identifier of X'0001' that 
   is used for internal system tracking.
