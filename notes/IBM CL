Declare Processing Options (DCLPRCOPT) - if it is present in source, it has to be first command followed by rest of the declare commands.

This command is valid only within a CL program or ILE CL procedure. All declare commands (DCL, COPYRIGHT, DCLF, and DCLPRCOPT) 
must follow the PGM (Program) command and must precede all other commands in the program. 
The four types of declare commands can be intermixed in any order.

To have the DO and SELECT nesting levels appear in the compiler listing, specify *DOSLTLVL for the OPTION parameter on the
  Create CL Program (CRTCLPGM) command,
  Create CL Module (CRTCLMOD) command, or 
  Create Bound CL Program (CRTBNDCL) command

Common Messages in CL Compiler listing

 Cause . . . . . :   The SQL statement is not allowed for one of the following

 Recovery  . . . :   The statement cannot be run in this mode. For a CONNECT or 
   SET ENCRYPTION PASSWORD statement in a precompiled program, specify host     
   variables instead of constants. If in interactive SQL, you may syntax check  
   a statement by setting the statement processing value to *SYN.
