     The following list of object types can exist in a directory in the
     integrated file system:
     *BLKSF
         A block special file (*BLKSF) represents a user-defined file system
         which exists in a particular auxiliary storage pool (ASP).  The
         block special file enables the user-defined file system to be
         viewed and managed as a single entity.  The contents of a
         user-defined file system are made accessible by mounting the block
         special file in the integrated file system name space.
     *CHRSF
         A character special file (*CHRSF) object is associated with a
         device or resource of a computer system.  It has path names that
         appear in directories and has the same access protection as regular
         files.
     *DDIR
         A distributed directory (*DDIR) object is used in the integrated
         file system.  A *DDIR object can exist on a system and be accessed
         across the network.
     *DIR
         A directory (*DIR) object is used in the integrated file system.
     *DSTMF
         A distributed stream file (*DSTMF) object is used in the integrated
         file system.  A *DSTMF object can exist on a system and be accessed
         across a network.  A stream file contains a continuous stream of
         data.  Examples of stream files include:
          o  Documents stored in IBM i folders
          o  PC files
          o  UNIX files
     *FIFO
         A first-in first-out (*FIFO) object is a file type defined by UNIX.
         It provides a file that you can open for reading and writing, and
                                                                                                                        Page    10
         has the characteristic that all data read from the FIFO is read
         first-in first-out.  Once data is read, it is removed from the
         file.  All remaining data is discarded once all open instances are
         closed.  Blocking may occur on reads and writes, if no data is
         available or the FIFO is currently full.
     *SOCKET
         A local socket (*SOCKET) object allows two jobs running on the same
         system to establish a communications connection with each other.
         The object is allocated when one of the jobs uses the bind() socket
         function.
         After the connection is established, the jobs can exchange data
         with each other using the sockets functions such as sendto() and
         recvmsg(), or by using the sockets connect() function followed by
         integrated file system functions such as write() and read().
         When the jobs have finished communicating, each job uses the
         close() function to close the socket connection.  The local socket
         remains in the system until it is removed using the unlink()
         function or the Remove Link (RMVLNK) command.
         A local socket cannot be saved.
     *STMF
         A stream file (*STMF) object is used in the integrated file system.
         A stream file contains a continuous stream of data.  Examples of
         stream files include:
          o  Documents stored in IBM i folders
          o  PC files
          o  UNIX files
     *SYMLNK
         A symbolic link (*SYMLNK) object contains an integrated file system
         path name referring to another object.  The other object may or may
         not exist.  When an object is referred to using the symbolic link,
         the system uses the path name within the symbolic link to locate
         the object.
