CPU - 1000 CPW (POWER5 or newer processors recommended)
4 GB memory (in a private (non-shared) pool dedicated to Sterling B2B Integrator)
20 GB DASD (Required for Sterling B2B Integrator plus space for operating system, spool, utilities, and so on).
File system space will be needed if you are using the option to store documents on the file system. 
The amount of space needed will vary depending on the size of documents to be stored and the length of time you choose to retain documents on the file system.

Source member can start with any alphabet or 3 sp. chars (viz. $, # and @)
Source members sorted in ascending order in PDM (priority: sp_char > alphabet > numeric)
1.0 $$
1.1 $a
1.2 $1
2. #
3. @
4. A
5. 1 - source member can't start with a numeric

5761-SS1 IBM i operating system V6.1 - generates CL/CMD's compiler listing.
5770-WDS IBM Rational Development Studio for i V7.4 - generates RPG/SQLRPG's compiler listing
5770-SS1 IBM i Operating System V7.4 - generates compiler listing for *FILEs (PF/LF/DSPF/PRTF)
IBM DB2 for i (earlier DB2/400)

IBM i Access Client Solutions 

Processor: POWER7
Cfg: 32-core

Compiler
CL - IBM Control Language Compiler 
CMD - IBM iSeries Command Definition Compiler 
PF/LF/DSPF/PRTF -  IBM System i5 Data Description Processor 

You could get the following data fron Compiler listing
1. IBM i Version/Release/Modification
2. User/Object Name
3. Date and Time
4. System Name (CLLE)

width of a compiler listing *SPLF is 132 character
*FILE (PF/LF/DSPF/PRTF) have  Data Description Source
  Buffer positions (In/Out), RCDFMT Name, Field Length, Field Name, Field Type, Field's Attributes (like Field TEXT, Field COLHDG)
  *INdicators used, Referenced Lib/File/Fields
*PGM (RPGLE/SQLRPGLE) have Source Specifications
  Difference bewteen Line No. (on left) and Seq No. (on Right)
*PGM (CLLE) has Control Language Source

RPG debug source
  starts from *MODULE ENTRY AND MAIN PROCEDURE ENTRY
  ends at *MAIN PROCEDURE EXIT (usually followed by turning off LastRecord *INdicator i.e. *INLR)
  
To rename COLHDG or TEXT of a Table using SQL, no need to use ALTER, directly use LABEL

*BNDDIR
