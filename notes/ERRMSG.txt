Cause . . . . . :   The file is program defined and an interactive data    
  definition utility (IDDU) definition should be used; however, there is no
  IDDU data dictionary definition linked to member FLAT112 file FLAT112 in 
  library UDSMT.  The query will use the definition of the file as it was  
  defined when it was created.
