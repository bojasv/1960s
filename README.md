## Welcome to the computing world that started in 1970s

Here you can find some tools and resources that would be helpful to you as an IBMi student or professional.

### About me and IBMi

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

What are some programming languages that I've used on an IBMi?
There are two models of programming languages on IBMi, OPM and ILE
OPM (Old Programming Model) - only supports traditional IBMi languages (like CL, RPG, SQLRPG etc.)
1. CL (source-member type: CLP)
2. RPG (source-member type: RPG)
3. SQLRPG (source-member type: SQLRPG)

ILE (Interactive Language Environment) - independent of programming language, hence supports collaboration with newer languages as well (like C, C++, Java, PHP, Node.js, Python etc.)
1. CL (source-member type: CLLE)
2. RPG (source-member type: RPGLE)
3. SQLRPG (source-member type: SQLRPGLE)

Popular technologies I'm exploring while working on IBMi
for data-handling and data-presentation
1. MS Excel (.csv, .xlsx, .xls)
2. Plain text (.txt)
3. PDF (.pdf)
4. HTML - rarely in demand
5. HTTP URL - rarely in demand, I used it via a ProfoundUI function pui.openURL

for data-exchange
1. XML (using SOAP API)
2. JSON (using REST API)

for data-transmission
1. FTP (invoked using RUNRMTCMD and batch/CMD scripts present at PC)
2. IBM IFS
3. IBM WebServices

open source support (OSS) for IBM i
5733-SC1 (OpenSSL and OpenSSH) - necessary for SSH clients like PuTTY, Code For i (VSCode Pkg)
5770-DG1 (Apache HTTP Server and XML Service)
5770-JV1 (Java)
5773-OPS (Open Source for IBM i) - created in 2014; deprecated since 2019-12-15; not supported beyond 7.2; use RPM-based open source pkgs

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/bojasv/1970/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact
