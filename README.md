What are some programming languages that I've used on an IBMi?
There are two models of programming languages on IBMi, OPM and ILE
OPM (Old Programming Model) - only supports traditional IBMi languages (like CL, RPG, SQLRPG etc.)
1. CL (source-member type: CLP)
2. RPG (source-member type: RPG)
3. SQLRPG (source-member type: SQLRPG)

ILE (Interactive Language Environment) - independent of programming language, hence supports collaboration with newer languages as well (like C, C++, Java, PHP, Node.js, Python etc.)
1. CL (source-member type: CLLE)
2. RPG (source-member type: RPGLE)
3. SQLRPG (source-member type: SQLRPGLE)

Popular technologies I'm exploring while working on IBMi
for data-handling and data-presentation
1. MS Excel (.csv, .xlsx, .xls)
2. Plain text (.txt)
3. PDF (.pdf)
4. HTML - rarely in demand
5. HTTP URL - rarely in demand, I used it via a ProfoundUI function pui.openURL

for data-exchange
1. XML (using SOAP API)
2. JSON (using REST API)

for data-transmission
1. FTP (invoked using RUNRMTCMD and batch/CMD scripts present at PC)
2. IBM IFS
3. IBM WebServices

open source support (OSS) for IBM i
5733-SC1 (OpenSSL and OpenSSH) - necessary for SSH clients like PuTTY, Code For i (VSCode Pkg)
5770-DG1 (Apache HTTP Server and XML Service)
5770-JV1 (Java)
5773-OPS (Open Source for IBM i) - created in 2014; deprecated since 2019-12-15; not supported beyond 7.2; use RPM-based open source pkgs

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/bojasv/1970/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact
